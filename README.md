## Features

- **Minimalistic output**: aiming to adhere to the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), footy's output can easily be piped to other tools
- **Portable**: minimal [dependencies](#dependencies)

## Install

Since footy uses the data provided by [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/), an api-key is required.
You can register for one [here](https://www.football-data.org/client/register) for free.

Once footy is installed, set the api-key by running `footy -k <api-key>` or manually create the file `$HOME/.config/footy/api-key.txt` containing only the api-key.  

### Build from source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fritzrehde/footy.git
cd footy
sudo make install
```

**Note:** The makefile defaults to some default paths for installed files. Adjust to your system:

- `INSTALL_DIR`: PATH for executables (default /usr/local/bin)

```shell
make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/bin
```


## Usage
```text
OPTIONS:
  -s                Prints standings/table
                    Must be used with -c <COMPETITION>
  -m <DAYS+/->      Prints upcoming ('+' suffix) or previous ('-' suffix) matches
                    Must be used with either -c <COMPETITION> or -t <TEAM>
  -c <COMPETITION>  Specifies competition (use code or id)
  -t <TEAM>         Specifies team (must use team's id)
  -I                Prints all supported competitions
  -i <COMPETITION>  Prints all teams in competition (use code or id)
  -r                Unformatted output for piping to other tools
  -k <API-KEY>      Saves the api-key to $HOME/.config/footy/api-key.txt
  -h                Prints this help message
```

### Supported competitions and teams
`footy -I` gives you an overview of all the supported competitions (I recommend piping the output into a [pager](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html)).

`footy -i BL1` or `footy -i 2002` prints all teams in the Bundesliga using either the *Code* `BL1` or the *Id* `2002`.

Some competitions do not have a *Code* and teams never have a *Code*, so you will have to use the *Id* there.

**Note**: Access to some of the smaller competitions/teams is paid ([pricing](https://www.football-data.org/coverage)). Therefore, the *Price* column shows which competitions are free.

### Piping output to other tools

The `-r` option provides unformatted output, where the columns are seperated by commas instead of whitespaces and the match dates are in the ISO-8601 UTC format.

#### Example
```
footy -s -c BL1 -r | cut -d ',' -f 1-6,10 | column -ts ','
```
This command will only display the first six and the tenth column of the standings output.
